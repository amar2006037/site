    <h1>Procedure of connecting JS file with HTML file.. </h2>
    <p>There are following three ways in which users can add JavaScript to HTML pages..</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Embedding Code</li>
        <li>Inline Code</li>
        <li>External File</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h1>Embedding Code</h1>
    <p>To add the JavaScript code into the HTML pages, we can use the <script>.....</script> tag of the HTML that wrap around JavaScript code inside the HTML program. Users can also define JavaScript code in the <body> tag (or we can say body section) or <head> tag because it completely depends on the structure of the web page that the users use.</p>
    <p>We can understand this more clearly with the help of an example, how to add JavaScript to html</p>
    <script>document.write("This is an example of Embedding Code.!!!WELCOME!!!")</script>
    <script>document.write("In this example we saw how to add JavaScript in the head section")</script>
    <hr>
    <h1>Inline Code</h1>
    <p>Generally, this method is used when we have to call a function in the HTML event attributes.</p>
    <p> There are many cases (or events) in which we have to add JavaScript code directly eg., OnMover event, OnClick,etc.</p>
	<P>Let's see with the help of an example, how we can add JavaScript directly in the html without using the <script>.... </script> tag.</P>
	<input type="button" value="click hear" onclick="alert('This is an example of Inline Code.!!!WELCOME!!!')"/>
    <hr>
    <h1>External File</h1>
    <p>We can also create a separate file to hold the code of JavaScript with the (.js) extension and later incorporate/include it into our HTML document using the src attribute of the "script" tag.</p>
    <p>It becomes very helpful if we want to use the same code in multiple HTML documents. It also saves us from the task of writing the same code over and over again and makes it easier to maintain web pages.</p>
    <p>n this example, we will see how we can include an external JavaScript file in an HTML document.</p>
	<input type="button" value="click hear" onclick="display()"/>
</body>
